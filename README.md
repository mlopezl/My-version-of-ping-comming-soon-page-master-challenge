## Overview
This project is a **coming soon subscription page** for a fictional service called Ping.  
Users can enter their email address to subscribe and be notified when the service launches.

The interface features:
- A clean and responsive layout  
- Real-time email validation on submit  
- Visual error feedback  
- Social media links with hover states  

## The Challenge
Users should be able to:

- Enter an email address into the subscription input field  
- See error messages when the email format is invalid  
- See hover states for interactive elements  
- View the layout clearly on all screen sizes

## My Process

3. Added a consistent visual style using **CSS custom properties (variables)**.  
4. Styled the form, input states and social icons with hover and active styles.  
5. Implemented an email validation system using **regular expressions in JavaScript**.  
6. Applied error and success feedback through dynamic class manipulation.  
7. Finalized responsive behavior for small screen sizes using media queries.
